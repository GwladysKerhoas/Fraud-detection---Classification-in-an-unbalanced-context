# Fraud-detection-Classification-in-an-unbalanced-context

Authors : Chloé Danet, Candice Rajaonarivony, Gwladys Kerhoas

We have carried out this project on learning in a context of unbalanced data with a more precise application on fraud detection. The work carried out will 
compare several prediction methods seen in the course. We will therefore describe our approach and the results obtained in order to deal with this subject 
using the Python programming language.
